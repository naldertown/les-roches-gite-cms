  title: Why Les Roches?
  description: >
    Les Roches is within easy access of the N10, a slice of paradise in amongst
    the rugged beauty of the Poitou-Charentes region. With easy access to
    popular destinations such as Futuroscope, The Valley of the Monkeys, Chateau
    Verteuil, Angouleme, Niort, Poitiers and La Rochelle. Les Roches is the
    perfect base if you're just travelling through as it is situated 5 mins from
    the N10 which runs all the way down to the south of France and Spain. 

    Poitiers airport is 35 min north on the N10 and flights run from London Stansted 3 times a week. We are also pet friendly and have 2 small dogs of own.
description: Head to the nearby town of Chaunay and enjoy a coffee and watch the
  world go by or head to some of the historic local towns such as
  Verteuil-sur-Charente to explore the Chateau and restaurants. Civray is 20
  mins away with a few restaurants and bars and the town of Couhe is 10 mins
  away where our favorite local restaurant is 'Melkins' and they serve the best
  pizza I've ever eaten! There's also bars, boulangeries and vets, dentist and
  doctors and a couple of supermarkets with petrol stations also. We also have
  lots of fishing lakes and kayaking on our doorstep. There's so much to see and
  do.

      Two very spacious and lovely bedrooms with an extra 2 single beds on the
      mezzanine above the main living area, a comfortable lounge, and a very
      well fitted out kitchen. Bathroom and shower are on the ground floor,
      plenty of outdoor space which is another plus for the gite to make your
      holiday most enjoyable.

  - quote: The gite is stunning, in October we are enjoying the real fire after a
      day of sunshine in nearby historical Poitiers! The bed is so comfy, stayed
      in many James villas properties where this wasn‚Äôt the case. The gite
      owners left wine which was a lovely touch. Everything has been furnished
      to a high end, we are looking forward to revisiting. Next time when we
      stay longer we would love to visit La Rochelle and Bordeaux
