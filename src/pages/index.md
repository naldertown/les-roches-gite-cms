  title: Why Les Roches?
  description: >
    Les Roches is within easy access of the N10, a slice of paradise in amongst
    the rugged beauty of the Poitou-Charentes region. With easy access to
    popular destinations such as Futuroscope, The Valley of the Monkeys, Chateau
    Verteuil, Angouleme, Niort, Poitiers and La Rochelle. Les Roches is the
    perfect base if you're just travelling through as it is situated 5 mins from
    the N10 which runs all the way down to the south of France and Spain. 

    Poitiers airport is 35 min north on the N10 and flights run from London Stansted 3 times a week.
description: Head to the nearby town of Chaunay and enjoy a coffee and watch the
  world go by or head to some of the historic local towns such as
  Verteuil-sur-Charente to explore the Chateau and restaurants. Civray is 20
  mins away with a few restaurants and bars and the town of Couhe is 10 mins
  away where our favorite local restaurant is 'Melkins' and they serve the best
  pizza I've ever eaten! There's also bars, boulangeries and vets, dentist and
  doctors and a couple of supermarkets with petrol stations also. We also have
  lots of fishing lakes and kayaking on our doorstep.There's so much to see and
  do.
